       "'Western Australia’s Golden Outback is known for its vast, wild beauty – but beyond the salt lakes, red-rock expanses and sweeping white-sand beaches lies a rich Aboriginal cultural landscape waiting to be explored. Here, in a place of ancient stories and deep connection to country, two Aboriginal-owned tour operators offer unforgettable experiences that reveal the spirit of the land. For anyone seeking more from their journey – deeper perspectives, cultural understanding and a sense of place shaped over tens of thousands of years – these are experiences not to miss. Walk in the footsteps of ancestors Aerial view of Hellfire Bay, near Esperance. Photo credit: Tourism Western Australia. In Esperance (Kepa Kurl), Annie Dabb and her family welcome visitors to their ancestral lands via Dabungool Cultural Experiences. Named after Annie’s grandfather, Dabungool is a family-run business grounded in Nyungah culture and a strong sense of place. Each guided walk shares cultural stories tied to the land, highlighting the seasonal foods, plants and animals that have long sustained life in this region. The Hellfire Bay Walk is a journey through one of the most scenic and lesser-known spots in Cape Le Grand National Park (Mandoowernup). Walking from Hellfire Bay to Little Hellfire Bay, you’ll learn about seasonal bush foods and plant life, and – in Makuru season (June-July) – may even spot migrating southern right whales just offshore. The trail winds among granite slabs and offers stunning coastal views, as guides provide insights into a landscape you’ll soon realise is rich with meaning for the Aboriginal people who have lived here for tens of thousands of years. Dabungool Cultural Experiences. Photo supplied. On the Taananedtj Trail at Dempster Head, you’ll forage for seasonal bush foods along a gentle walking track with sweeping views over Esperance Bay. Native herbs and edible plants are part of the story here, as you’ll discover through tastings and sensory experiences along the way. The Wudjari people recognise six seasons – Birak, Bunuru, Djeran, Makuru, Djilba and Kambarang – with seasonal indicators such as flowering plants marking when one season ends and another begins. The trail is dog-friendly, and classed as an easy walk, making it a great option for young families and travellers with mobility limitations. For those wanting to explore inland, the Murdidyyinakabi Walk at Lake Monjingup offers insights into one of the most biodiverse areas in WA. This wheelchair-accessible walk reveals an astonishing variety of flora and fauna – including the pincushion hakea – along with some of the stories embedded in the land. You’re likely to spot kangaroos, emus, frogs and birds while learning how the ecosystem guided traditional life. Discover the spirit of Wave Rock Katter Kich Gallery &amp; Tours. Photo supplied. Near Hyden, the iconic shape of Katter Kich, otherwise known as Wave Rock, rises from the outback like a cresting wave of granite. For Nyungar man Michael Ward, a guide who grew up in the region and has strong cultural ties to the land, this is more than a landmark – it’s a place of deep spiritual significance. Katter Kich Gallery &amp; Tours connects visitors to the cultural history and living stories of the area through the sharing of traditional knowledge and seasonal lore, as well as providing access to some of the sacred sites here. The Half Day Tagalong Tour invites guests to follow Michael in their own 4WD vehicles as they visit places such as the Humps and Mulkas Cave. Along the way, he shares the Dreaming story behind the cave – a cautionary tale passed down through generations – and points out native bush foods, medicinal plants and local wildlife. For early risers, the Morning Tour begins at Hippos Yawn and includes a gentle climb for panoramic sunrise views across the salt plains and outback. You’ll learn about ancient hand stencils, traditional tracks and the cultural significance of each formation, while soaking up the shifting colours of the landscape in morning light. Hippos Yawn near Wave Rock. Photo credit: Tourism Western Australia The Twilight Tour showcases the changing hues of Wave Rock at sunset to the squawks and chatter of galahs flying overhead. The tour includes a moderate climb and finishes with Dreaming stories and cultural insights shared beneath the towering granite. Both the Morning and Twilight tours include visits to ancient art sites, as well as talks on how the seasons influenced the gathering of food and medicine in this semi-arid environment. If you’re heading to Western Australia’s Golden Outback, Aboriginal cultural experiences can provide a deep understanding of places you might otherwise pass by – whether you’re on a windswept beach or a hilltop trail, or at the base of a towering rock. Through storytelling, seasonal knowledge and walking together on country, these tours offer travellers opportunities to see this land in a new light. Discover more at westernaustralia.com.'"

      "A wide range of economic data in recent months has fallen short of official forecasts, raising concerns that the growth target was at risk and that a reliance on a combination of rising domestic property values and exports was holding back growth. The 5% growth target is relatively modest by historical standards. China’s central bank cut interest rates and eased local bank lending rules this week in its boldest intervention to boost the economy since the coronavirus pandemic.\n",

      "How that occurs – whether due to government intervention, supply side issues, or companies raising prices to maximise profits – does not make it any more or less real. And so the monthly inflation data out yesterday (which admittedly is always a bit less accurate than the quarterly figures) showed inflation over the past year rose 2.7% – within the RBA’s target of 2% to 3%: If the graph does not display, click here A significant reason for the drop from 3.5% in July was the federal government’s \n",

      "Well it sure as heck would feel real to people paying for electricity. At any rate, the “trimmed mean” measure of “underlying” inflation fell from 3.8% to 3.4% – marginally above the 3% ceiling of the RBA’s target – hardly a worrying level at all. But the point about “real” inflation also became pertinent this week when the ACCC alleged what most of us suspected, that Coles and Woolworths raise their prices in such a way as to make it seem like it is actually a sale.\n",

      "Yesterday, Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, said interest rates would fall “gradually”. In an interview with KentOnline, he said that “inflation has come down a long way” – it was 2.2% in August, just above the central bank’s target, having fallen from over 11% in autumn 2022. Last week, the Bank left interest rates on hold at 5% – but Bailey said he is “very encouraged” that inflation will fall.\n",

      "Last week, the Bank left interest rates on hold at 5% – but Bailey said he is “very encouraged” that inflation will fall. Sweden’s Riksbank has cut interest rates and signalled further reductions in the coming months and early next year, as inflation has fallen below the central bank’s target. It cut its policy rate by 0.25 percentage points to 3.25%, saying: Inflationary pressures have fallen over the year and are now assessed to be compatible with an inflation rate of around 2%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Low and stable inflation and falling interest rates are contributing to a recovery in the economy. Headline inflation has continued to fall from a peak of of over 10% in 2022, coming in at 1.2% in September – below the Riksbank’s forecast and its 2% target. It started cutting rates in May, the first easing in eight years, followed by another move in August.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, the forecast indicates one or two further rate cuts during the first half of 2025. The policy rate is thus expected to be cut at a clearly faster pace than was previously communicated, which contributes to stronger economic activity and an inflation rate close to the target. The oil giant BP is holding a board meeting in India this week, as it scouts for more opportunities in the country.\n",

      "The Co-op Group, which owns Britain’s seventh-biggest supermarket chain, is back in the black, as growth in membership and its quick commerce business offset rising costs. The Co-op, which is owned by its members, said the number of members had grown by 20% to 5.5 million, putting it on target to reach 8 million by 2030. The group has a partnership with Uber Direct, allowing shoppers to order groceries on the Co-op website with delivery through the Uber Eats’ network.\n"
