"Stock market today: Netflix and AI excitement send Wall Street to the brink of an all-time high","January 22, 2025","By STAN CHOE, AP Business Writer","Netflix, Oracle and other big technology stocks lifted Wall Street Wednesday as their profits pile higher and excitement builds around the moneymaking prospects of artificial intelligence. The S&P 500 rose 0.6% and came close to its all-time closing high set early last month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 130 points, or 0.3%, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 1.3%. The gains came even though most U.S. stocks fell under the weight of another crank higher for Treasury yields in the bond market. The smaller stocks in the Russell 2000 index lost 0.6%, for example, and roughly two out of every three stocks in the S&P 500 sank. Gains for big, influential stocks were more than enough to make up for it.

Oracle added 6.8% following its 7.2% rise the day before, ahead of the expected announcement about Stargate, a joint venture involving Oracle, OpenAI and SoftBank to invest up to $500 billion in AI infrastructure in Texas.",756
"Trump issues an executive order to suspend the US TikTok ban. But can it stick?","January 21, 2025","By SALLY HO, Associated Press","President Donald Trump signed an executive order Monday to keep TikTok operating for 75 days, a relief to the social media platform's users even as national security questions persist. TikTok's China-based parent ByteDance was supposed to find a U.S. buyer or be banned on Jan. 19. Trump's order could give ByteDance more time to find a buyer. The law allows for fines of up to $5,000 per U.S. TikTok user against major mobile app stores and internet hosting services like Oracle if they continued to distribute TikTok to U.S. users beyond the deadline. Trump said he is looking to have the U.S. government broker a deal for 50% control of TikTok.
